# Locating Single Assets

To find a tagged asset via RFID:

 1. From the app’s main menu, select Find Assets.
 2. Find the asset you’re looking for, either by scrolling or using the search box, and press the asset name.
 3. Using the slider, set the reader’s power level as desired (for asset locating, you’re usually going to want it high).
 4. Press the green > button.
 5. The percentage bar will increase the closer the tag is to the reader; the reader will also beep faster the closer you are.
 6. When you’re done, press the stop button.
