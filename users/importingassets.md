# Mass Importing Assets

Note that you should add the categories, asset types, locations, custom fields, etc, that you need prior to importing your assets. See the [setup documentation](https://github.com/TEC-RFID/rfid-asset-documentation/blob/main/users/setup.md) for more details. 

 1. In the web portal, select All Assets in the sidebar.
 2. Click Import (top right corner).
 3. Click Download Template.
 4. Open the Excel template downloaded.
 5. Fill in the Excel sheet with your data and save.
    - Fields marked with an * are required; any others may be left blank.
    - Use placeholder text for the EPC field, as you’ll need to add these properly in the app later.
 6. Back in the web portal, click Upload Excel File and select your saved file from step 5.
 7. Click the upload button (looks like a sheet of paper with an arrow).
 8. If your import is successful, your assets will be added. If there are any errors:
    - A notification will appear by your username at the top right. Click your name, then select ‘Download Error File’ from your notifications.
    - Refer to the new spreadsheet to fix any errors in your data, then return to step 6 and upload again.
