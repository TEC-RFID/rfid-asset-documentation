# Stocktakes

To stocktake a location using RFID:

 1. From the app’s main menu, select Stocktake.
 2. Select New.
 3. Select the correct reader; then select the criteria you want to stocktake on.
    - You can filter your stocktake by location, user, category, or a combination thereof.
 4. Press Create Stocktake.
 5. Using the slider, set the reader’s power level as desired (high or low depending on how many tagged assets you’ve got in your general area and how precise you want to be).
 6. When you’re ready, press Start Scan. The reader will locate as many tagged assets as it can, counting what it’s found onscreen. When you’re done, press Stop Scan.
 7. The app will show you a summary of the stocktake:
    - Found: assets it located and expected to find within your set criteria
    - Missing: assets it expected to find but could not locate
    - Misplaced: assets it located but did not expect to find in this location
    - New: tags located that have not been added as assets
10. When you’re done, press Mark as Complete (you may need to scroll down to see the button).

Your stocktake data will be saved under Stocktakes, accessible for analysis later in either the app or web portal.
