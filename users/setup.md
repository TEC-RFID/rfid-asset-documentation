# Before You Start

Before you start using TEC-RFID Asset, it's a good idea to plan out how you want to structure your data--this will help prevent you from having to spend lots of time updating existing assets later on. No two setups are going to look alike--it depends entirely on what it is you're tracking and what you want to do with the data. 

This is a broad-strokes summary: if you would like further detailed setup guidance, we'd be happy to help! 

 - What are your goals?
   - Knowing what success looks like to you heavily influences how you configure your tracking system.
   - Think about the sort of information you'd like to have at your fingertips when you scan an asset. What would you like to be able to see--or to update?
   - Do you want to export data to other locations or integrate with other apps?
 - Who are your users going to be?
   - What sort of information will each of your staff members need?
   - What level of access will they require?
   - You'll want at least two people to have full admin access so you have a backup in case of staff absence. 
 - What locations will you need to list?
   - What areas are you going to want to stocktake? How specific do you want to get? 
   - Aim for a good balance between specific and vague: a cabinet, for example, rather than a whole room or a single shelf. 
   - You can nest locations inside each other (but note that stocktakes will not search sublocations). 
   - If you have an existing warehouse labelling system, it'll likely make sense to carry that over.
   - Locations don’t have to be a single fixed physical location—they could be a van, for instance, or a tool bag.
 - What categories / asset groups will you need?
   - Both are used to sort assets, but with key differences. You can use one, both, or neither. Assets can belong to both a group and a category.
   - Categories are usually going to be your first choice for asset organisation. You can use them to filter stocktakes, and they can be nested inside each other.
   - Asset groups are useful if you need to do additional filtering that doesn't fit into your category structure. They are not used for filtering stocktakes and they cannot be nested. 
   - Example: an IT department tracking equipment might use asset groups for equipment type--monitors, laptops, phones, etc--and categories for the department they're assigned to--accounting, sales, marketing, etc. This would allow them to easily stocktake a single department's equipment while still separating the assets into their physical types.
 - What asset types / custom fields will you need?
